# Monster Hunter: World Board Game Campaign Tracker

This is a small project I've been casually working on during the weekends. The
goal is to create a means to fully track the progress of your hunter throughout
the course of a campaign.

Live Application [https://awndrooo.github.io/mhwbg-campaign-tracker/](https://awndrooo.github.io/mhwbg-campaign-tracker/)

## Goals (planned)
These goals are currently on the TODO list and should happen.
- ~~Full monster carve materials and equipment from all expansions (not complicated just time consuming to add)~~ Done: 2023-05-28
- ~~Proper display of item icons with rarity coloring~~ Done: 2023-05-28
- ~~Import/Export profiles. Data stored in IndexedDB so currently susceptible to browsers clearing data.~~ Done: 2023-04-22
- Full hunter sheet display (First Draft: 2023-06-04)
  - Armor based on currently equipped items
  - Current attack deck and damage deck
  - Campaign day, notes, and potions
- Toggle off darkmode (Not sure anyone actually wants this but seems good to have)
- Add new stuff from future Iceborne box (release late 2024)
 - Steamforged wanted an additional +$350USD just to include the additional Overpowering Hunger and Vaal Hazak expansion on top of the existing "monstrous" pledge so these items will not be initially included in the update

## Goals (not promised)
These goals push the line of pipe-dream features and may or may not happen depending upon the future of this project.
- Completely mobile friendly. Always aiming for mobile friendly but my work mostly focuses on function over form for now.
- Equipment crafting that utilizes hunters material inventory (versus trying to use forge reference to figure out what you can craft with your current mats)
- Keep track of specific tasks/hunts completed on campaign days
- Desktop native client with local save persistance (probably ElectronJS)
- Print friendly hunter sheet
- Hunter profile picture
- Board recording: When you don't have time to finish a game, mark down monster health/breaks/position/time and hunter health, hand, & stamina boards.
 - Bit of a pipe dream on this one as it may require weapon attack cards to be entered (which I just don't have time/energy to do)
