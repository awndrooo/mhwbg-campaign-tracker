# MH:W Board Game Campaign Tracker

This is a small project I've been casually working on during the weekends. The
goal is to create a means to fully track the progress of your hunter throughout
the course of a campaign.

Live Application [https://awndrooo.github.io/mhwbg-campaign-tracker/](https://awndrooo.github.io/mhwbg-campaign-tracker/)

## Goals (planned)
These goals are currently on the TODO list and should happen.
- Full monster carve materials and equipment from all expansions (not complicated just time consuming to add)
- Proper display of item icons with rarity coloring
- Import/Export profiles. Data stored in IndexedDB so currently susceptible to browsers clearing data.
- Toggle off darkmode (Not sure anyone actually wants this but seems good to have)

## Goals (not promised)
These goals push the line of pipe-dream features and may or may not happen depending upon the future of this project.
- Completely mobile friendly. Always aiming for mobile friendly but my work mostly focuses on function over form for now.
- Full hunter sheet display with print friendly format
    - Armor based on currently equipped items
    - Current attack deck and damage deck
    - Maybe profile picture? Data is stored in IndexedDB so not sure about viability without major compression
- Equipment crafting that utilizes hunters material inventory (versus trying to use forge reference to figure out what you can craft with your current mats)
- Keep track of specific tasks/hunts completed on campaign days
